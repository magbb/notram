# Norwegian Transformer Model

The project "NoTraM - Norwegian Transformer Model" is owned by the National Library of Norway. 

## Project Goal
* Build transformer-based models for Norwegian and Nordic languages based on modern transformer architectures (BERT,Roberta,T5 a.o)
* Build and publish a state-of-the-art Norwegian corpus for unsupervised language training, and make it available to the NLP community
<br />

# Norwegian Colossal Corpus
The Norwegian Colossal Corpus is an open text corpus comparable in size and quality with available datasets for English. 

The core of the corpus is based on a [unique project](https://www.zdnet.com/article/norways-petabyte-plan-store-everything-ever-published-in-a-1000-year-archive/) started in 2006. In the digitalisation project the goal has veeb to digitize and store all content ever published in Norwegian. In addition we have added multiple other public sources of Norwegian text. Details about the sources as well as how they are built are available in the [Colossal Norwegian Corpus Description](https://github.com/NBAiLab/notram/tree/master/guides/corpus_description.md).

The easiest way to access the corpus is to [download from HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/datasets/NbAiLab/NCC). This site explains in details how the corpus can be used. It also gives an extensive information about the content of the corpus, as well as how to filter out certain part of the corpus and how it can be combined with other Norwegian datasets like [MC4](https://huggingface.co/datasets/mc4) and [OSCAR](https://huggingface.co/datasets/oscar).

In addition to the corpus itself we do provide a set of scripts for [creating](guides/create_scripts.md) and [cleaning](guides/cleaning_rules_description.md) corpus files. We also provide a guide where you can follow us in creating a corpus for your data sources [step-by-Step Guide about how to create corpus file](guides/step_by_step_guide.md), and a description about how to [create and upload a HuggingFace dataset](guides/creating_huggingface_dataset.md). Other tools and guides can also be found on our [Guides Page](guides/README.md). We have made all our software available for anyone to use. Most of it is written in python 3. 


# Pretrained Models
The following pretrained models are available. These models have to be finetuned on a specific task. The finetuning is straight forward if you have a dataset available. Please take a look at the Colabs below for sample code. Often you will only need to change a couple of lines of code to adapt it to your task.
| Name  |  Description | Model|
| -------- |  :-----| ----------:|
| nb&#8209;bert&#8209;base | The original model based on the same structure as [BERT Cased multilingual model](https://github.com/google-research/bert/blob/master/multilingual.md). Even if it is trained mainly on Norwegian text, it does also maintain some of the multilingual capabilities. Especially it has good scores on Swedish, Danish and English. | [🤗&nbsp;Model](https://huggingface.co/NbAiLab/nb-bert-base)|
| nb&#8209;bert&#8209;large | The model is based on the BERT-large-uncased architecture. For classification tasks, this model will give the best results. Since it is uncased it might not give as good results on NER-tasks. It might require more processing power both for finetuning and for inference.| [🤗&nbsp;Model](https://huggingface.co/NbAiLab/nb-bert-large)|


# Finetuned Models
These models are finetuned on a specific task, and can be used directly.

| Name  |  Description | Model|
| -------- |  :-----| ----------:|
| nb&#8209;bert&#8209;base&#8209;mnli | The nb-bert-base-model finetuned on the mnli task. See model page for more details. | [🤗&nbsp;Model](https://huggingface.co/NbAiLab/nb-bert-base-mnli)|
| saattrupdan/nbailab&#8209;nb&#8209;basenb&#8209;nernb&#8209;scandi | This NER model is trained by Dan Saatrup on top of our nb-bert-base. It has been fine-tuned on the concatenation of DaNE, NorNE, SUC 3.0 and the Icelandic and Faroese parts of the WikiANN dataset. The model yields better results on Norwegian NER tasks than the models only finetuned on Norwegian. See model page for more details. | [🤗&nbsp;Model](https://huggingface.co/saattrupdan/nbailab-base-ner-scandi)|


## Results
The NB-BERT-Base model is thoroughly tested in the article cited below. Here are some of our results:
| Task  |   mBERT-base| NB-BERT-base |
| -------- |   -----:| -----:|
|POS - NorNE - Bokmål|98.32|**98.86**|
|POS - NorNE - Nynorsk|98.08|**98.77**|
| | | |
|NER - NorNE - Bokmål|81.75|**90.03**|
|NER - NorNE - Nynorsk|84.69|**87.67**|
| | | |
|Classification - ToN - Frp/SV|73.75|**77.49**|
|Sentence-level binary sentiment classification|73.27|**84.04**|

* *F1-scores on test dataset. Both models were finetuned for 4 epochs with learning rate 3e-5.*


# Colab Notebooks
The original models need to be fine-tuned for the target task. A typical task is classification, and it is then recommeded that you train a top fully connected layer for this specific task. The following notebooks will allow you to both test the model, and **to train your own specialised model** on top of our model. Especially the notebook about classification models that trains a sentiment classification task, can very easily be adapted to training any NLP classification task.

    abstract = {In this work, we show the process of building a large-scale training set from digital and digitized collections at a national library. The resulting Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)-based language model for Norwegian outperforms multilingual BERT (mBERT) models in several token and sequence classification tasks for both Norwegian Bokm{\aa}l and Norwegian Nynorsk. Our model also improves the mBERT performance for other languages present in the corpus such as English, Swedish, and Danish. For languages not included in the corpus, the weights degrade moderately while keeping strong multilingual properties. Therefore, we show that building high-quality models within a memory institution using somewhat noisy optical character recognition (OCR) content is feasible, and we hope to pave the way for other memory institutions to follow.},
